/*

In this exercise you will code an entity class Team and a client class Main. 
You will create private attributes on the entity class 
and give it a parameterized constructor, a toString and a setter method.

1.a Create a class Main with a main method.

1.b Create an entity class called Team.

1.c Add a private instance variable a.k.a attribute to Team to hold the team name.

1.d Add another private instance variable to hold the Teams rank (some number).

1.e Add yet another private instance variable to hold the names of players in the team.

1.f Add a constructor with a parameter, 
so that the Team can be instantiated with a team name. 
Make sure the parameter value is assigned to the mathcing instance variable.
Hint
public Team(String teamName)

1.g From the main method in the Main class, 
create an instance of the Team class (instantiate the Team class).

1.h In the Team class add a method called setRank that takes a number 
and assigns it to the rank attribute.

1.i From the main method, 
call the method setRank on the instance of Team you created in step 1.g 
with a number of your choice.

1.j In the Team class add a toString method that returns a String formated like this:
"Hold: De Uovervindelige Rang: 3"
(Precise wording will depend on the name 
and rank of the Team instance you have created in step 1.g)

1.k From the main method, create 5 more Team instances and print them.
